# StreASM

> A stream processing language for the criminally insane

StreASM is a stream processing language styled after Assembly instructions. It operates on numerical inputs.

It was created by [Daniel Lockyer](https://github.com/NeoSilky) and [Jet Holt](https://github.com/Jetroid) as part of the Programming Language Concepts module at the University of Southampton.

The StreASM interpreter is written in OCaml using `ocamllex` and `ocamlyacc`.

Full documentation is in the [project report](https://github.com/neosilky/StreASM/blob/master/docs/StreASMDocumentation.pdf).
